        <h2>Possible Solutions:</h2>
        <p><b>1)Transition to renewable energy:</b>Use more sunlight,wind and water to make electricity
       instead of burning coal and oil.These resources are better of the enviornment and help reduce air
   pollution.</p>

   <p><b>2)Energy efficiency and conservation:</b>Save energy ny using better machines and equipments
   that don't use better machines and equipment that don't use as much power.Turn off lights
   and appliances when you're not using them to save electricity.</p>

   <p><b>3)Plant more trees and take care of forests:</b>Trees are like nature's air filters.They take in bad air 
   and give us good air to breathe.Planting more trees and taking care of the ones we have can help
clean the air and reduce global warming.</p>

<p><b>4)Use better ways to travel:</b>Use buses,trains,or bikes instead of cars when you can. Electric cars are better
for the enviornment because they don't make the air dirty.</p>
<p><b>5)Put a price on things that make the air dirty:</b>Make things that pollute the air more expensive
so that people will use them less.This can help encourage companies to find cleaner ways to make things.</p>
<p><b>6)Farm in a way that doesn't hurt the enviornment:</b>Use fewer chemicals on plants,and try to grow food in a way that doesn't hurt the soil or the water.</p>

<p><b>7)Work with other countries to solve their problem together:</b>When countries work together,they can find better ways to stop global warming.It's important for everyone to help because
the Earth belongs to all of us.</p>
<p><b>8)Make things stronger to handle bad weather:</b>Build things like houses and road in a way
that can handle floods,storms,and other bad weather.This can help keep people safe when the weather
gets really bad.</p>
<p><b>9)Keep trying to make new things that don't make the air dirty:</b>Scientists are always trying to
find new ways to make electricity without using things that make the air dirty.These new things can help
us stop global warming.</p>
<p><b>10)Tell everyone how important it is to take care of the Earth:</b>Talk to your friends
and family about how we all need to work together to take care of the Earth.Small changes like using 
less electricity or recycling more can add up and make a big difference.</p>
